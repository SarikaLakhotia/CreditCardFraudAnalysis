# CreditCardFraudAnalysis

## Overview
This project is designed to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a combination of Python for data preprocessing and model building and Power BI for visualizing trends and results interactively. The primary objective is to analyze transaction data, identify patterns of fraudulent behavior, and create an actionable framework for fraud detection.

## Technologies Used
1. **Python:** For exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning model development.
2. **Power BI:** For creating interactive dashboards to monitor fraud trends and visualize key insights.
### Libraries:
1. **Pandas & NumPy:** Data manipulation and statistical analysis.
2. **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Visualization of data and relationships.
**Scikit-learn:** Model implementation and evaluation.
**Isolation Forest:** Anomaly detection technique for fraud detection.

## Features
**Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, scaling, and preparing the dataset for machine learning.
**Exploratory Data Analysis:** Identifying patterns in transaction data, including fraud trends.
**Machine Learning:** Using Isolation Forest and other algorithms for fraud detection.
**Power BI Dashboards:**
> Visualization of fraud vs. legitimate transactions.
> Monitoring transaction trends over time.
> Highlighting key fraud metrics and model performance.

## Results
> Achieved high accuracy and an F1-score of 0.95 using machine learning models, ensuring effective fraud detection.
> Developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to monitor real-time trends and provide actionable insights into fraudulent activities.
